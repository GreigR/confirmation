# Introduction

George Boole (1815 - 1864) was born in Lincoln and died in Cork. He was a self-taught mathematician and educationalist, who was too poor to attend Cambridge (Chap.4, @machale2014life) yet became the foundation professor of mathematics at Cork and a Fellow of the Royal Society (Chap.5, @machale2014life). His work has influenced much of what has followed particularly with regards to Computer Science and logic. He first used the “Universe of Discourse” (p. 30 @boole1854investigation) and the abstract variable type of logical variables is called a Boolean in some computer languages like Pascal (@hayward1986compared).

Boole was no means some random savant, emerging from the wilderness to transform academia without access to prior learning. Although he is sometimes portrayed as such, he was very much engaged in the spirit of the age (Chap. 1, @machale2014life). @machale2014life outlines how that Boole’s father, John, was indeed a cobbler, whose business was challenged, which had a significant constraining influence on Boole’s life choices.  The reason for this state of impoverished affairs was that John lacked interest in being a Cobbler. Preferring instead to make optical instruments, and John was a life long learner in science, literature and mathematics. Indeed, even when famous George’s mother regarded his father as being more gifted despite George’s fame (@machale2014life).

As a child, George was fascinated with mathematics and other “abstract” subjects. His father taught George the joy of practical science through the family telescope and his father’s love of astronomy. However, George had a broad reach of interests including the humanities, arts and sports but was by nature a quiet, retiring, man (@machale2014life). It was George’s interests in the humanities that first drew his brilliance to public attention, although his father’s financial situation limited his choices, George attended a period of secondary education and supplemented this by learning several European languages. This enabled George to stay abreast of academic learnings in Europe (@machale2014life).

This state of relative impoverishment meant as George had to buy all his own books, he focused on mathematics as being better value for money. Admirers also gave him access to similar such as Lacroix’s *Differential and Integral Calculus* or Newton’s *Principia* (@nahin2017logician). Being self-taught, meant he was self-reliant and needed to develop a rigour to his study as he lacked teachers to ease his academic journey (@machale2014life).

By 1844, Boole earned a Royal Medal for his paper on the “On a general method on analysis” (@boole1844viii) and by 1849, despite not having any degree, Boole, was appointed the foundation professor in mathematics at Queen’s College in Cork, Ireland (@nahin2017logician). Boole would reside in Cork until his death but married in 1850. He had five daughters, all of who were equally talented in a plethora of subjects in their own right(@machale2014life).

In 1854, Boole published the key work of relevance to this study, “An Investigation Of The Laws Of Thought, On Which Are Founded The Mathematical Theories Of Logic And Probabilities” (@boole1854investigation).

# Key Idea

@boole1854investigation seeks to bridge the gap between words and symbols, built on the preface “that Language is an instrument of human reason (p. 17)” although admitting that some have argued to reason without such an assumption.

The formulation rules of Boole’s algebra are;

A language consists of words which are signs or symbols, where a sign is admittedly arbitrary in its definition, within a given context and other associated signs.
Such an arbitrary definition may be contextual but within that context, it is also consistent within that context.
Such conceptual signs are represented by symbols as x, y…
+, -, * are signs of operation by which conceptual signs are combined or similar...
= is the sign for identity.
A combination of signs like “xy” is taken as the combination of x ^ y.
Given 6, then “xy = yx”.

Then Boole’s key insight can be developed;

\begin{equation}
 xy = x
\end{equation}

Which is taken to mean for a combination object “white horned sheep” expresses a class of objects like all sheep. Then consider the case where;

\begin{equation}
 xx = x
\end{equation}

Which is the case where x is of the same class as y. Hence;

\begin{equation}
 x^2 = x
\end{equation}

Which is only true if x = 0 or x = 1.


# Boole's Ontology

## An Investigation of the Laws of Thought
For @boole1854investigation his book “An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities” was his seminal work. Clearly it has given inspiration to others in fields like Computer Science, Number theory and Logic. Boole was clear his focus was on logic and reasoning;

*“1. The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. ”* ( @boole1854investigation, paragraph 1.1).

For Boole, this was an evolution from his previous work “The Mathematical Analysis of Logic” (@boole1847mathematical), rather “An Investigation of the Laws of Thoughts” was 

*“Its earlier portion is indeed devoted to the same object, and it begins by establishing the same system of fundamental laws, but its methods are more general, and its range of applications far wider. It exhibits the results, matured by some years of study and reflection, of a principle of investigation relating to the intellectual operations, the previous exposition of which was written within a few weeks after its idea had been conceived...”* (@boole1854investigation, p. iii).

Boole also linked his work back to Whately’s earlier “Elements of Logic” (@whately1826elements). @Neumann2018whately described Whately’s work as introducing Aristotelian logic to the Victorian public. By the beginning of the 17th century, Oxford University was the last remaining stronghold of Aristotle’s logic, but it was under attack from all sides largely seen as useless, fit only to torture undergraduates (@Neumann2018whately). 

@whately1826elements published a widely popular defence of Aristotle that ran to nine editions and introduced logic to the Victoria public. “Elements of logic” describe the development of logic from the pre-socratic greek philosophers to Locke. For @whately1826elements, logic was both a science and an art. It was science when it was applied to the “theory of reasoning” and art when the application of knowledge into practice (@whately1826elements, p. 1).

In “Of the Operations of the Mind and of Terms”, Whately starts to consider what Boole would expand upon (Of the Operations of the Mind and of Terms, p. 251). Namely, the three states within the mind. The first is “Simple-apprehension” is the sense perception of an object. Such apprehension can be either “incomplex” (or a single object like a horse) or complex (or conjunction of simple objects to make a complex concept like a man on a horse). Such objects can be compared or judged to see if they agree or not. While reasoning, for Whately, is proceeding from initial judgements to subsequent judgements based on the results of earlier comparisons or new apprehensions (@whately1826elements, pp. 251-252).  This cyclical learning from earlier information or judgements is reminiscent of what will become “Bayes theorem” where new observations update prior probabilities. Boole will build upon the Whately’s stance that information was the sense derived cognitive representation of an external object on which the mind acted.
