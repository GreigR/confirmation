# Chapter 5: The communication channel

Dretske opens by arguing that knowledge (in the sense of a factoid) is absolute, it is either right or wrong. One can not have more knowledge about whether the light is on or off. One can know more about a wide array of topics *and I assume that a topic is a collectioon of facts plus some other factor such as a narrative belief.

This builds onto the concept of a threshold for justification, which Dretske clearly does hold with. He builds that his absolute concept of knowledge is based on the underlying information. So information about *s* comes in degress but the information that *s* is *F* is binary and therefore absolute. If K transmitts the knowledge that *s* is *F* to K' then K' will have exactly the same absolute knowledge that *s* is *F*.

## The claim there is always some equivication
Reviewed the contribution of Peter Unger on the concept of absolutes. This argument was built from the perception of flatness, where a flat surface was one without bumps or lumps. If such should be found then such a surface can not be flat, and you can always find lumps if you look hard enough, including with a microscope.

Such then leads to comparisons of degrees of flatness, so A is flatter than B, which means B was clearly not flat. So does this mean that much of our **concept knwledge** because it is not absolute is not knowledge? Oddly, Dretske then allows for relative absoluteness. So a raod can be realtively flat in comparsion to the surroundings or other bits of road without being abolustely flat as in the concept of flat. Somehow, given his previous statements, this is OK for Dretske. **Go figure**.

Dretske then builds that minor irregularities that seemingly detract from absolute information and hence **certain knowledge** are not irregularities at all, particularly from the perspective of communication.

## Channel conditions
The discussion turns to the ability of the channel to correctly communicate the signal, even if it delivers the same answer as the original signal. Dretske, rightly, outlines the long list of potential problems with any measuring device. So even if *C* can communicate that *s* is *F* correctly, then is are alternative states *C'* such that delivers the false positive that *s* if *F*, when it is not.

From this sceptical perspective any sensory state ha equivication present, even if everything is working as expected. In an information-centric model, determining how much and therfore what information is carried about the source, no actual condition cane be taklen as fixed. The observer can never be 100% the result is as per the instrument. Unless either there is something that precludes the channel from being abn state in the channel or these are known on independent grounds to be in a normal state then the signal will not carry information about the source.

The sceptical formula states that a signal does not carry information unless another signal indicates the state of the chanel. Drekste argues that the channel either caries no information or no new information. For Drekste;

*"The channel of communication = that set of existing conditions (on which the signal depends) that either (1) generate no (relevant) informaiton or (2) generate only redundant information (from the point of view of the receiver"*

Hence of the conditions on which the signal depends only the source as a generator of new information. Assuming the machine is appropriately maintained its contibution to the signal is constant and the signal itself only varies with the amount of information carried by it.

There may be systematic errors (the machine broke) which adds information, but Drekste talks of how scientific equipiment needs to be calibrated and checked prior to use (think pre-flight checks) to exclude such a possibility. Drekste makes the point the neurotic technician who checks the channel endlessly does change the quality of the information in the signal beyond the technician who checks the channel at the recommended intervals.

Drekste goes on to discuss, which conditions for perception are sub-optimal. He points out that the channel can still transmit signal but the equivication may be increased in such circumstances, even to the point of awareness. Drekste also uses this distinction to sidestep how auxillary channels are monitored for consistency. Either they aren't because they add no new information to the signal or they self monitor each other. 


There is commentary on the probability of the failure in a chanel system, through consideration of eye movements. Here the body seems to use eye movement as a means of detecting object movement that is used in combination with image changes. If the eye muscles are paralysised then objects seem to move even though neither the eye or the object is actually moving.

For Dretske, this is explained by the information is transmitted over the faulty channel. The channel has no new alternative states so adds new information and provides a fixed framework within which any equivication from the signal is reckoned. 

## Scepticism
Further to the above, scpeticism about the channel, does not alter the information it contains. Dretske proposes a perfect and utterly reliable pressure gauge on a boiler. One engineer, becoming anxious, installs an auxillary system to monitor the pressure guage. The shift technician, before being briefed about the new auxillary monitor notices the warning has been activated but the reliable pressure guage says the system is functioning normally. Does the technician "know" the boiler is operating normally or in another way which does she fix, the boiler or the new circut? From the information centric perspective, the technician has the same knowledge as previously. 

Drekste proposes an alternative interpretation. Supposing that the consequences were so high of a boiler rupture, an auxillary system was deemed essential. Then of course the auxillary system might also malfunction leading to a proliferation of monitoring equipments, each with a known failure rate that is say higher than the original guage. Is the technician any the wiser than they were originally, in fact due to scpticism, the technician is now unable to make a decision about the state of the boiler, and indeed will always be unable to make a decision as such scepticism can never be extinguished.

Other sources of scepticism considered includes realism. Guages are wrong and so redundency of channels is often justified. Equally, no channel can carry more information that the signal source. Drekste makes the sensible point, because something could be a source of equivication, does not mean it is a source of equivication, because some channel broke, does notr mean this channel is broken. Until we have evidence to the contrary, what we see is what we get *except expectations do drive perceptions*.

Sceptical doubts do not drive equivication. Driven instead is the ability to form the requiste beliefs based on the accurate information.

This does raise the question of when is there a relevant or genuine possibility of doubts in the integrity of the channel. Goldman is quoted as arguing a relevant alternative is one that must be excluded for a knower to be evidentially able to claim certain knowledge attributed them. The challenge from scepticism is how to exclude contigencies as being considered as genuine possibilities as otherwise every signal is equivocal. For communication theory a genuinine alternative possibility is one which one impacts the equivication of the signal and therefore the information it contains.

Dretske argues in communication theory a channel is innocent until proven guilty, and that what has happened previously is a good guide as to what can happen in the future. If a given signal has only occured when *s* is *F*, the given presumption is that it can occur only when *s* is *F* and evidence to the contrary, not just a lively imagination, is required the channels reliability can be brought into doubt.

There is the struggle over the subjective nature of information and knowledge. Dretske argues that an information centric theory of knowledge does have similar challenges. Some can be addressed throught the definition of the communication system. There is the source, from which information is received over a channel, which contributes no new information. There is still cognitive bias on what is the source on the matter of inquiry.
