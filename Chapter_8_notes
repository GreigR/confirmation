# Chapter 8: The structure of Belief.

The aim of this chapter is bridge the gap between true and false beliefs from the perspective of Dretske's theory. 

His initial position is that a structure's semantic content is identified with the information contained in the fully digitized form. Hence as the information can not be false, the semantic content can not be false. Then it follows as we do have false beliefs, beliefs are not semantic structures. Equally, the information-centric analog of belief must be capable of having false content (p.190).
