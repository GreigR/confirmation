# Chapter 9: Concepts and Meaning

**Definition**
*A concept is a type of internal structure, when instantiated, exercises control over system outputs (p. 214).* 

So when a concept is substantiated realtive to some perceptual object *s* there is a *de re* belief with the propositional content that *s* is *F*. 

Dretske keeps returning to versions of an intresting circularity that beliefs require concepts, and having concepts inplies the capacity for having beliefs. He does make the valid point that even though concepts are internal abstractions, meaning can be external.

So a semantic structure only becomes a concept when there is alignment of the representational (or semantic) and the functional. 

## Simple and complex concepts
There is a digression to considering how *F* and *G* can be nomically equivalent, yet be different concepts. Dretske's solution is to have one as a simple concept and the other as a complex concept. So *s* being *F* maybe nomically equivalent to *s* being *G* but being *G* consists of being *H* and *K* (p.215). So they are semantically equivalent but distinct cognitive structures and will influence behaviour differently, even if the manifestations are similar or identical.

*This is the opening of the Dretske's struggles with the junction between his information centric theory of knowledge and the behaviour consequences.*

He uses the example of a square being a member of the set of quadralaterals. A human and a chimpanzee could learn that pushing the square button achieves some goal, for Dretske there is no evidence that a chimpanzee has the concept of quadralateral as a separate concept to the simple concept of square while a human does. 

*Who knows how he figures that out.*

Equally for Dretske, the concepts of water and H~2~O are different cognitive structures despite being informationally indistinguishable on informational grounds. 

To solve the problem of how to acquire the knowledge that robins are a type of bird, and what is a robin, given that these have the same informational content, Drekste focuses on this being an encoding problem leading to the acquisition of belief and therefore knowledge.

For Dretske then a learner gets taught about *F* and *not-F* under suitable conditions and further that *s* is *F* and so develops a *F-token*, that is triggered by *s* but need not contain the information that *s* is *F* under less ideal conditions. Hence one can teach some child about a robin without teaching them about birds. *Good luck with that.* Slightly more realistically one can learn a concept like "I have struck gold", without understanding Gold as a chemical element. 

**Hence information can lead to a distinction betwen what is known a priori about a type of thing and what is necessary (essential) for a thing to be of that type.**

## The informational Origin of Concepts
For Dretske the semantic basis of primitive concepts is sense derived information. Hence Unicorns are only complex concepts as there is no informational basis to underpin a primitive concept of unicorn. He then attempts to explain that the concept of a red ball is fundamentally different from the concept of red leant by viewing a white ball under a red light. *I bet it isn't as the detinition of red is the reflection of red wavelength light into the eye and whether the original source was all colors (is sunlight) or only one (red) is not going to make much difference to what hits the retina.* 

He also uses the example of the other earth which identical to earth except water is not H~2~O but ABC, although it is fundamentally equivalent in every other way. So the semantic concept of water is fundamentally different even though the properties are identical, which seems more accessible but still mute. See page 226 for details.

Dretske argues that to learn the concept of red, one needs to be exposed to red. A better example is the red green color blind man who learns that various shades are called "red" without having a concept of "red". 

Hence the claim that one can not learn that *s* is *C* unless one also knows the concept of *C*. Which leads to a digression on innate concepts. He argues that innate concepts must be genetically encoded but originally based on information.
